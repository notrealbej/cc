### **Task 1: Networking with VirtualBox - Explore Bridge, NAT**  

**Aim:**  
To explore and understand the networking modes in VirtualBox, specifically **Bridged Networking** and **NAT (Network Address Translation)**, and how they affect virtual machine (VM) connectivity.  

### **Theory:**  
VirtualBox provides multiple networking modes to connect virtual machines to a network. Two commonly used modes are:  

1. **Bridged Networking:**  
   - The VM gets an IP address from the same network as the host machine.  
   - The VM behaves like a physical machine on the network.  
   - Can directly communicate with other devices in the network.  

2. **NAT (Network Address Translation):**  
   - The VM is assigned a private IP and shares the host's IP for external communication.  
   - Best for internet access without exposing the VM to the local network.  
   - No direct access to the VM from the network unless port forwarding is configured.  

### **Program (Key Points to Cover):**  
- Open VirtualBox and navigate to VM **Settings â†’ Network**.  
- Select **Bridged Adapter** and test connectivity (check IP, ping, access LAN).  
- Select **NAT** and verify internet access.  
- Compare network behavior in both modes.  
- Use commands like `ip a`, `ifconfig`, `ping`, and `traceroute` inside the VM to observe changes.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- Understanding of how Bridged and NAT modes work in VirtualBox.  
- Ability to configure and test network settings for VMs.  
- Practical knowledge of how different networking modes affect communication and connectivity.
