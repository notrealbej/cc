### **Task 1: Explore Golang Features**  

**Aim:**  
To explore the key features of the Go programming language, including its simplicity, concurrency model, and performance benefits.  

### **Theory:**  
Go (Golang) is an open-source, statically typed, compiled language designed by Google. It emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency. Some key features include:  
- Statically typed with type inference.  
- Garbage collection for memory management.  
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels.  
- High performance due to compiled execution.  
- Built-in support for networking and web services.  

### **Program (Key Points to Cover):**  
- Install Go and set up the environment.  
- Explore basic syntax (variables, loops, functions, structs).  
- Understand Goâ€™s standard library and package system.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- Understanding of Goâ€™s key features and benefits.  
- Familiarity with basic syntax and structure.  
- Ability to write simple Go programs.

### **Task 2: Write a Hello-World Service Using Golang**  

**Aim:**  
To create a simple HTTP service in Go that returns "Hello, World!" when accessed.  

### **Theory:**  
Go is widely used for building web services due to its built-in `net/http` package. A basic web server in Go listens on a port and serves HTTP requests efficiently.  

### **Program (Key Points to Cover):**  
- Import the `net/http` package.  
- Define an HTTP handler function.  
- Start a web server on a specific port.  
- Run and test the service using a web browser or `curl`.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- A functional HTTP server in Go.  
- The ability to send and receive HTTP requests.  
- Successful display of "Hello, World!" on accessing the endpoint.

### **Task 3: Explore Goroutines Using One Program**  

**Aim:**  
To understand and implement Goroutines in Go for concurrent execution.  

### **Theory:**  
Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by Goâ€™s runtime. They allow multiple tasks to run concurrently without the complexity of traditional threading. Goroutines use channels for safe communication.  

### **Program (Key Points to Cover):**  
- Create a function to be executed as a Goroutine.  
- Use the `go` keyword to start a Goroutine.  
- Implement multiple Goroutines running in parallel.  
- Synchronize them using channels or `sync.WaitGroup`.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- Execution of multiple Goroutines concurrently.  
- Understanding of Goâ€™s concurrency model.  
- Efficient task execution without blocking the main thread.
