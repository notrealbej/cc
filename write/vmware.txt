### **Task: Exploring VMware vSphere and Performing Live Migration**  

**Aim:**  
To explore VMware vSphere by logging into the vSphere server, viewing the data cluster and attached VMs, cloning a VM, and using vMotion to perform live migration of the VM to another host.  

### **Theory:**  
VMware vSphere is an enterprise-level virtualization platform that provides centralized management of virtualized infrastructure. Key components include:  
- **ESXi Hosts:** The physical servers running virtual machines.  
- **vCenter Server:** The centralized management platform for ESXi hosts and VMs.  
- **Clusters:** Groups of hosts that share resources for high availability.  
- **vMotion:** A feature that enables live migration of running VMs between hosts with minimal downtime.  

### **Program (Key Points to Cover):**  

#### **Step 1: Log in to VMware vSphere Server**  
- Access the vSphere Web Client using the provided credentials.  
- Navigate to **Hosts and Clusters** to view the data cluster.  
- Check the number of virtual machines attached to hosts.  

#### **Step 2: Clone a VM with Your Name**  
- Select an existing VM running on **Host A**.  
- Right-click â†’ **Clone** â†’ **Clone to Virtual Machine**.  
- Name the cloned VM as per your requirement.  
- Choose storage, network settings, and finalize cloning.  

#### **Step 3: Use vMotion to Migrate the VM to Another Host**  
- Ensure that **vMotion** is enabled on both source and destination hosts.  
- Right-click the VM â†’ **Migrate**.  
- Choose **Change compute resource only** (Live migration).  
- Select the destination host.  
- Monitor the migration process in **Recent Tasks**.  

#### **Step 4: Run the Migrated VM on the New Host**  
- Verify that the VM has successfully moved to the new host.  
- Check network connectivity and resource allocation.  
- Ensure the VM remains operational post-migration.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- Successful login to vSphere and visualization of the data cluster.  
- Cloning of a VM on **Host A** with a custom name.  
- Live migration of the VM to another host using vMotion.  
- Confirmation that the migrated VM runs smoothly on the new host.
